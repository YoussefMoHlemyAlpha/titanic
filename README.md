# Machine Learning Final Project - Titanic Dataset Analysis & Classification Algorithms
In this project, our objective is to conduct an in-depth exploration and analysis of the Titanic
dataset. We use three distinct classification algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes,
and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to forecast the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the
Titanic. Furthermore, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for comprehensive analysis. Our
study includes a comparative examination of the performance of these algorithms based on various
evaluation metrics.
